  "bio": "I enjoy building interactive systems. Game development is something I've been doing since forever, frontend development is what I do professionally. The same curiosity now goes into Ethereum experiments and AI explorations on the side. I prototype a lot, across different domains, and learn by doing rather than reading about it.",
